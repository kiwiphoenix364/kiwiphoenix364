### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I'm a dude on the internet that likes MakeCode Arcade and coding in general
- Making my own Minecraft modpack right now! Code name is RL20, providing a similar experience to RLCraft in 1.20.1
- I've done MakeCode Arcade blocks, Typescript, Javascript, a little bit of HTML/CSS, Arduino IDE (C++), Python, and recently Visual Basic
- I enjoy gaming on my (slow) pc like Minecraft, Poly Bridge, Bloons, as well as some games on consoles
- I also like 3d printing. I recently got a N4P (runs Klipper) and it produces some great prints!
