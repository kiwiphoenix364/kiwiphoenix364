### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I'm a dude on the internet that likes MakeCode Arcade and coding in general.
- I like to make projects that are unique or interesting to me, usually game mechanics that I want to make or to see how I would develop a game mechanic from another game.
- I've done MakeCode Arcade blocks, Typescript, Javascript, a little bit of HTML/CSS, Arduino IDE (C++), Python, and recently Visual Basic.
- I enjoy gaming on my (slow) pc like Minecraft, Poly Bridge, Bloons, as well as some games on consoles.
- I also like 3d printing. I recently got a N4P (runs Klipper) and it produces some great prints!
