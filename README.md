### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I'm a dude on the internet that programs stuff 
- Making my own Minecraft modpack right now! It is named CALDERA (not an acronym for anything), providing a similar experience to RLCraft in 1.20.1
- I've done MakeCode Arcade blocks, Typescript, Javascript, a little bit of HTML/CSS, Arduino IDE (C++), Python, and recently Visual Basic
- I enjoy making and playing games
- PC building is cool ig
